# Eggs: The Website

This is a Single Page App about eggs made in React.js. It is an improved version of [egg](https://github.com/ashalexis/egg).

Eggs can be visited here at [eggs](https://ashalexis.github.io/eggs/).
The Figma mockup, also done by me, can be found at [eggs-figma](https://www.figma.com/file/bFiA9k3i2c4lhiLIaQaI55/v1.0?node-id=2%3A2).

## Updates

**12/11/2020:** 
* Initialized the first ever draft of eggs
* After much struggle, implemented a dark mode using `styled-components`
* Learnt React Router from `react-router-dom` and used it to link to placeholder pages.
